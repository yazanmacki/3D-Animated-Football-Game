# 3D-Animated-Football-Game

This was the first project I worked on in Unity. It is a football game involving turns taken
between player and goalkeeper. It involved 3D character models that are animated to shoot/save
the ball. After working on this project for a while a decided to abandon it and make a new
and simplified version, in which no 3D animations were involved. This allowed me to focus on 
the thing I enjoyed more, the game mechanics, rather than putting all my efforts into the 
animations.
